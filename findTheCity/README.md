practice for _**D**ocument**O**bject**M**odel_

my suggestion guessing list to go through all of possibilities.

**rom** 	--> we should go west and north

**berlin** 	--> we should go west and south

**stuttgart**-> we should go west and north

**arnheim**  -> we should go east and south

**bonn** 	--> we should go west and north

**dusseldorf**> we should go east and north

**bochum**  --> we should go west and south

**Essen**	--> we have won


**ok after so many trials, I've found out the api has a problem.
for example it gives latitude -88 for arnheim although it should be 5**
but it was a good practice
